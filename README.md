# OXID Slider for categories

*This module extends OXID to show the bannerslider of OXID's theme flow in category sites. OXID actions are extended to a new actiontype called categoryslide or "Kategorienslide". The functions like assigning products or links are like those of the original banner actions.*

## Compatibility
Tested with CE 4.10.2 and EE 5.3.2. I think it should also work with PE, but i haven't checked this yet.

## Installation
To use the module:

1. copy all files and directories inside the folder copy_this to the root directory of your OXID Installation.

2. activate the module in your backend.

3. add actions of type categoryslide and assign the category, you want the slider/banners to be shown.

### Recommendation
It is recommended to backup your database and OXID-Installation before installing the module. It also might be a good idea to install this modul in a test-environment (stagearea) to see if it fits your requirements before porting it to a productive system.
