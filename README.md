OXID Slider for categories

This module extends OXID to show the banner-slider of OXID theme flow in categoriy-sites. OXID actions are extended to a new actiontype called categoryslide or "Kategorienslide". The functions like assigning products or links are like those of the original banner actions.

Tested with CE 4.10.2 and EE 5.3.2. I think it should also work with PE, but i haven't checked this yet.
